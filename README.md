This is an example of standing up a simple API using Loopback 2.0.

The API 
uses an in-memory store as the backend and is not attached to a real database.
The API can be visualized using the API explorer shipped with Loopback framework.
After clonig this app, please run `npm install` within the application directory
to download and install the dependent modules from npm global registry.

**NOTE**: The `/server/discover.js` script will not run until you install, add,
and configure a MySQL data source, following the instructions in
[Getting Started with LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB2/Connect+an+API+to+a+datasource).
